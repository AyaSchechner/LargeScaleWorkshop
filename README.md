This project implements the infrastructure for a scalable, service-oriented environment. It includes three services: a Test Service for various functionalities, a Registry Service for service discovery, and a Cache Service using an in-memory cache backed by a Chord Distributed Hash Table (DHT). The system integrates multiple technologies such as Protocol Buffers, MetaFFI, Beautiful Soup, gRPC, and ZeroMQ, using Go as the main language with interoperability between Go, Python, and Java.
